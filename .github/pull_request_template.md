## Notes for reviewers

<!-- Anything reviewers should focus on, risks, follow-ups. -->

## Issue

<!-- Closes #<number> on a line of its own for each issue of this repository this change completes (Closes owner/repo#<number> means the same). Refs #<number> when it only relates to one. A change with no issue says "Task: none, <reason>" on a line of its own. -->

## Acceptance evidence

<!-- One row per acceptance criterion of every issue this change closes, copied exactly from the issue's "- [ ] ACn" list. Evidence class is code, live or browser. In Proof, put repository paths in backticks, and write anything else (a command, a read-back, a run) without them. Delete the example row. Leave the table out only when the change closes no issue. -->
